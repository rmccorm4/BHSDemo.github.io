# Intro to Computer Science!

I will be doing a presentation to students at my University's local high school to encourage them to pursue Computer Science in the future.

## Demo Ideas

1) How to create a website and host it on GitHub

2) How to create a simple game using PyGame

3) Intro to basic programming skills/concepts
